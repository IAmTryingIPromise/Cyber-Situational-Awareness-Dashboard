# Cyber-Situational-Awareness-Dashboard

This repository is about a Thesis that was conducted in 2025 for Democritus University of Thrace.



A Cyber-Situational Awareness Dashboard to assist organization administrators with being aware of the dangers and vulnerabilities their organizational assets are facing.

It combines CVE, CWE, CAPEC and ATT&CK as information sources.

It uses metrics such as CVSS, EPSS and Risk Level to assess the severity of each CVE and the overall risk of an asset.
